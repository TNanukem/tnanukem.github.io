## About Myself

---

Data Scientist graduated as a Computer Engineer from the University of São Paulo, I have experience with prediction models for different tasks such as investment allocation, pricing, assortment, and demand forecasting. I'm currently enrolled in the Masters in Computer Science program at the University of São Paulo, researching with a focus on improving the predictive power and scalability of graph neural networks for high-dimensional graphs. I also have experience with Machine Learning code productization, machine learning engineering, and data science team management.

My interest areas include complex networks, deep learning, machine learning engineering, and data products.

I also am the creator and maintainer of the scikit-net, an open-source library with machine learning algorithms for complex networks.

### Career

#### Stone Payments

I've worked at Stone Payments as a summer internet with a routing system for the sales team. This system generated optimized sequence of visits aiming to minimize the traveled distance while maximizing the expected LTV of the visited leads. This system was integrated into a more general commercial intelligence system at the company.

Preliminary results generated an estimate of over R$ 10MM in productivity gains for the company in the year of 2019.

Used frameworks and tools: Python, Salesforce, Complex Networks
