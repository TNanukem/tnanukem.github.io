## About Myself

---

Data Scientist graduated as a Computer Engineer from the University of São Paulo, I have experience with prediction models for different tasks such as investment allocation, pricing, assortment, and demand forecasting. I'm currently enrolled in the Masters in Computer Science program at the University of São Paulo, researching with a focus on improving the predictive power and scalability of graph neural networks for high-dimensional graphs. I also have experience with Machine Learning code productization, machine learning engineering, and data science team management.

My interest areas include complex networks, deep learning, machine learning engineering, and data products.

I also am the creator and maintainer of the scikit-net, an open-source library with machine learning algorithms for complex networks.

### Career

#### Stone Payments

I've worked at Stone Payments as a summer internet with a routing system for the sales team. This system generated optimized sequence of visits aiming to minimize the traveled distance while maximizing the expected LTV of the visited leads. This system was integrated into a more general commercial intelligence system at the company.

Preliminary results generated an estimate of over R$ 10MM in productivity gains for the company in the year of 2019.

Used frameworks and tools: Python, Salesforce, Complex Networks

#### Big Data

I've worked at Big Data for over three years, from intern until a full data scientist with team management responsibilites. My main projects and accomplishiments at the company were:

- Worked as head of the assortment product, being responsible for executing, plan and propose methodological improvements to the product. Mentored the development of 3 data science squads in order to align their work with the product demands.
- Managed a team of data scientists in several retail projects.
- Technical and methodological refactor of investment allocation model to improve its performance, quality and effectiveness.
- Worked on the productization of all of the company's products, allowing them to be reusable. Also improved their performance.
- Fully developed a go-to-market strategy for a beverage company, comprising marketing allocation, assortment, pricing points and demand predictions per region.
- Developed models for forecasting demand, pricing and assortment.
- Developed quality assurance pipelines for machine learning data pipelines.
- Developed an experimentation framework based on multi-armed-bandits strategy for pricing optimization.

#### BTG Pactual
